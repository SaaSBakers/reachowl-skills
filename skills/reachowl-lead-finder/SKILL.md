# ReachOwl Lead Finder

The Apify Actor **finds** leads. ReachOwl MCP **imports** them and runs the outreach.

- Actor: [`superior_couch/reachowl-lead-finder`](https://apify.com/superior_couch/reachowl-lead-finder) (free; you pay Apify platform usage)

## Before you start

- Requires the ReachOwl MCP server connected with the user's token. If a tool reports a missing token, run the `reachowl-auth` flow.
- Requires access to Apify: either the Apify MCP server, or an `APIFY_TOKEN` for the REST API.
- Only crawl public pages the user has the right to use, and follow local rules on contacting people (consent, opt-outs).

## Workflow

1. **Confirm the brief**: start URLs, target audience, location, keywords, max leads.
2. **Pick the campaign**: `list_campaigns` and choose an existing one. If none fits, create one first with `reachowl-campaigns` (for example `audience_type: "file_upload"`, `status: 0`).
3. **Run the Actor in scrape-only mode** (`sendToReachOwl: false`):

```json
{
  "startUrls": [{ "url": "https://example.com/agents" }],
  "targetAudience": "real estate agents",
  "location": "Lahore, Pakistan",
  "keywords": ["real estate", "property dealer", "real estate agent"],
  "maxLeads": 100,
  "minLeadScore": 50,
  "sendToReachOwl": false
}
```

   - Apify MCP: call the Actor `superior_couch/reachowl-lead-finder` with this input.
   - REST (short runs): `POST https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/superior_couch~reachowl-lead-finder/run-sync-get-dataset-items` with header `Authorization: Bearer $APIFY_TOKEN` and the JSON above as the body.
   - Other inputs: `maxPagesPerSite` (default 25), `maxRequestsPerCrawl` (default 200), `scoreWeights`.

4. **Review the leads** with the user. Each item has `fullName`, `firstName`, `title`, `company`, `email`, `phone`, `website`, `facebookUrl`, `instagramUrl`, `linkedinUrl`, `sourceUrl`, `matchedKeywords`, `leadScore`.
5. **Import through MCP** with `add_campaign_contacts { campaign_id, audience }`, in batches of up to 500:

| Campaign platform | Keep leads that have | Row |
|-------------------|----------------------|-----|
| whatsapp | `phone` | `{ name: fullName, phone, company, title }` |
| facebook | `facebookUrl` | `{ name: fullName, profile_url: facebookUrl, company, title }` |
| instagram | `instagramUrl` | `{ name: fullName, profile_url: instagramUrl, company, title }` |

   Extra fields (`company`, `title`) become message variables (`{{company}}`, `{{title}}`).

6. **Verify**: `list_contacts { campaign_id }`.
7. **Start outreach** only after the user approves the messages: `reachowl-campaigns` (`update_campaign { id, body: { status: 1 } }`).

## Rules

- Never create a campaign just to hold uploaded leads if one already fits — use `add_campaign_contacts`.
- Importing through MCP uses the user's own ReachOwl token. Don't use the Actor's built-in `sendToReachOwl` import unless the user runs their own copy of the Actor with their `REACHOWL_API_KEY` secret set.
- Report how many leads were found, kept, and imported, and how many were skipped for missing phone or profile URL.
