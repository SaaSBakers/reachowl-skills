# ReachOwl Post Scheduler (Facebook groups)

## Before you start

- Requires the ReachOwl MCP server connected with the user's token. If a tool reports a missing token, run the `reachowl-auth` flow.
- Show the user the final post text and the target groups, and get a yes, before creating a scheduler that is on.

## MCP tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_groups` | `{ search?, page?, limit? }` — groups synced in the user's account |
| `list_app_states` | Connected Facebook accounts → `executor_id` |
| `list_post_schedulers` | `{ page?, per_page? }` |
| `get_post_scheduler` | `{ id }` |
| `create_post_scheduler` | `{ body }` |
| `update_post_scheduler` | `{ id, body }` |
| `delete_post_scheduler` | `{ id }` |

## Create a scheduler

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `name` | Required |
| `executor_id` | Required — Facebook account from `list_app_states` |
| `team_id` | Recommended (from `get_user`) |
| `group_urls` | Required — array (or comma-separated string) of `https://www.facebook.com/groups/…` URLs. Preferred over `group_ids` |
| `schedule_type` | `interval` or `calendar` |
| `interval` | Minutes between posts (interval mode) |
| `time` / `calendar_items` | `HH:MM` and calendar payload (calendar mode) |
| `posts` | Required — `[{ "text": "…" }]`, one or more posts |
| `clone_from` | Copy an existing scheduler id instead of building one |

```json
{
  "body": {
    "name": "Open house – June",
    "executor_id": 3807,
    "team_id": 7715,
    "group_urls": [
      "https://www.facebook.com/groups/123456789",
      "https://www.facebook.com/groups/lahore-property"
    ],
    "schedule_type": "interval",
    "interval": 20,
    "posts": [
      { "text": "Open house this Saturday in DHA Phase 6 — 3-bed, 10 marla. Comment or DM for the address." }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Manage

- Pause or resume: `update_post_scheduler { id, body: { status: 0 } }` / `{ status: 1 }`.
- Remove pending posts: `update_post_scheduler { id, body: { delete_queue_ids: [101, 102] } }`.
- Replace posts: send `posts` again (include `id` on posts you keep).
- Duplicate: `create_post_scheduler { body: { clone_from: 88 } }`.

## Errors

- `422` "groups were not found": the group isn't synced. Use `list_groups` to see what's available, or ask the user to sync groups from their connected Facebook browser.

## Good practice

- Write a slightly different version for each group's audience instead of one identical post everywhere, and respect each group's rules.
- Use a 15–30 minute `interval` rather than posting to many groups at once.
- To turn an article or announcement into group posts, see `reachowl-content-distribution`.
